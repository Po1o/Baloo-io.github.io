Recently I started training again and as I wanted to monitor my heart rate and a few other metrics, I picked up my old 2015 Apple Watch, the original Apple Watch, the Series 0. That's the only smart watch I owned. In the last few years I kept wearing it but only from time to time as it started to show its age. The watch did not get the latest OS updates and one can understand why: it is painfully slow. So as I increased my training load, I decided it was finally time to change it.

As I was looking for a new watch, I started reflecting on what I really needed. I really liked my Apple Watch but there are features I never really used and never really needed. So the first step for me was to list everything I wanted and the things I did not need:

I did not need to:
* be able to have a phone call from the watch. I think I did that once or twice because it was fun and then I never used that.
* be able to text from the watch or generally respond from the watch. I found it awckward to type on the watch - even though it is doing a good job with writing recognition.
* be able to listen to music or audio book from the watch

Howevever, I really needed:
* to receive notifications. I don't respond from the watch but it is key for me to receive notifications
* always on display
* Metrics for sport: pace, heart rate, etc...
